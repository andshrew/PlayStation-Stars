Following the outage during June 2024, PlayStation Stars is coming back online under a phased regional rollout.  

This page displays [the latest configuration](https://gist.github.com/NemesisWantsStars/f918417540cd2bbab44e14c6bf4da05d) that Sony have deployed to the PlayStation App, and lists the countries where the service has been restored. This data is periodically refreshed automatically, to check if new regions have been enabled.  

If your PlayStation Network account is from one of these countries then the Stars section of the PS App should be available again.  

So far Sony have enabled additional regions at ~21:00 UTC. Don't expect changes leading into, or over, weekends.  

:::tip

If your account is from a country that this page says is online again, but you still cannot access the Stars section of the app:

1. Try and force close the PS App, and start it again. This may force it to pull the latest configuration which re-enables the Stars section in your country or region.
2. Make sure you have the latest version of the PS App installed from your app store.
3. Wait a few more hours. The PS App only periodically updates configuration. If the above has not worked you may find it automatically becomes available after waiting for a few hours.
