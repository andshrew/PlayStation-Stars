# PlayStation Stars API Documentation

## Summary

PlayStation Stars is a customer loyalty reward service launched by Sony in late 2022. The service is free to join and enables members to earn rewards including collectible digital items, currency to spend on the PlayStation Store, and digital versions of PS4 and PS5 games.

Sony have an API for retrieving details of this service including the progress which a user has made through the reward tiers, the rewards they have earned and the campaigns (challenges) which are available to complete. As there is no public documentation for using the API this project is an attempt at documenting it.

This documentation can be viewed in a published format at [https://andshrew.github.io/PlayStation-Stars](https://andshrew.github.io/PlayStation-Stars/) courtesy of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
